# Visual Studio Code plus PlatformIO extension
Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

You can download VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once you have the repository cloned into your machine (see [Git guide](GIT.md)), open it with **Visual Studio Code**.

To do so, just open Visual Studio Code, go to *File > Open Folder* or you can open it from GitHub Desktop with the related button on the home page or in the menu *Repository > Open in Visual Studio Code*

Then, look for the folder containing your local version of the repository.

You should have something like this:

Once you are there, you will need PlatformIO extensions.

To do so, you can click on *View > Extensions*.

Look for the PlatformIO extension and install it.

After the installation you need to click on the *Open Project* on the PlatformIO home page.

Navigate to your local folder of polaris-opencore and select it (it's the folder containing the file *platformio-ini*).
