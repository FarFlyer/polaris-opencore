# Anima EVO Recharge

While the saber is charging with the power switch is "on":

- There will be one (1) blink of 300ms on the blade each 20 seconds.
- RED blink means recharging, BLUE blink means fully recharged
- Blink colors are pre-defined and cannot be changed by the final user.

Recharge will happen even if the switch is "off." (Just by connecting the saber to a USB with voltage) There will not be visual indications of the charge status, however.
