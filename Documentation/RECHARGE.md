# Anima EVO Recharge

While the saber is charging with the power switch is "on":

- There will be one BLUE blink of 300ms on the blade each 8 seconds during charging.
- There will be one RED blink of 300ms on the blade each 12 seconds when fully charged.
- Blink colors and timers are pre-defined and cannot be changed by the final user.
- Those parameters can be changed in the firmware.

Recharge will happen even if the switch is "off." (Just by connecting the saber to a USB with voltage) There will not be visual indications of the charge status, however.
