## Introduction
[LudoSport](https://www.ludosport.net/) masters created in 2006 a combat discipline with the lightsaber that spread a common language among the people practicing it, however the athletes didnâ€™t have a reference for their equipment yet.

In 2015 [LamaDiLuce](https://www.lamadiluce.it/) gave birth to Polaris, a new saber that would become the reference for hundreds of lightsaber enthusiasts who wanted to compete with an elegant weapon.

After 5 years, and after thousands of feedbacks from worldwide users, the new generation of saber is ready and you can contribute to the evolution of Polaris too.

- download and install a bunch of software
- get used to Git and GitHub in order to commit your changes

We strongly recommend to install VS Code and PlatformIO extension.

- [Get ready with GitHub](Documentation/GIT.md)

## Contributing
Any developer who wants to contribute to the project shall propose a completed merge into the master as a significant feature update for a release to the public (just one pull request with all the relevant details).

The changes are first reviewed in terms of coding, compatibility with previous versions and Scintilla SW. If the changes are ok and in line with the purpose of the lightsaber FW, the coulcil give the approval and a new release candidate is built.

This new release candidate is testes by selected developers and, if all the tests are passed, the master branch is updated and a new official FW version is released.
