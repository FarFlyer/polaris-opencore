## Introduction
[LudoSport](https://www.ludosport.net/) masters created in 2006 a combat discipline with the lightsaber that spread a common language among the people practicing it, however the athletes didnâ€™t have a reference for their equipment yet.

In 2015 [LamaDiLuce](https://www.lamadiluce.it/) gave birth to Polaris, a new saber that would become the reference for hundreds of lightsaber enthusiasts who wanted to compete with an elegant weapon.

After 5 years, and after thousands of feedbacks from worldwide users, the new generation of saber is ready and you can contribute to the evolution of Polaris too.

## FAQ

- **I'm using PlatformIO inside VSCode and I'm getting the error *"CoreEntryPoint.h: No such file or directory"***
    - Open the *platformio.ini* file and change or add the line: *lib_extra_dirs = ~/Documents/GitHub/polaris-opencore/libraries*
- **I'm getting an error message after connection with Scintilla *"An OpenCore Polaris was detected, but Scintilla failed to communicate with it."***
    - It could be normal for older firmware. Just go ahead and upload the latest FW (*Firmware Tools > Flash latest OpenCore firmware*)
